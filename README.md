# Typescript
Javascript which was initially a scripting language for adding trivial interaction to the web, has grown to be the preferred language for building applications of different sizes for both frontend and backend applications. However the language hasnâ€™t been able to live up to its expectation, posing diverse problems during development of large projects.

The most common kind of errors we programmars write are type errors, where we type a value where another value was expected. They include;
* simple typos.
* a failure to understand the API surface of a library
* incorrect assumptions about runtime behavior
* other errors

The goal of typescript is to become a **static type checker** for Javascript program. In other words a tool that run before you code runs and ensures that the type of the codes are correct.
